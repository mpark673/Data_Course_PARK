My idea for a data analysis project would be to use some data from my research to analyze
how effective different phages are against different strains of Salmonella. Several relevant
plot points that I would like to investigate are cell lysis time from initial exposure, burst
size, and how multiple exposures to the phage at different concentrations might affect
different aspects of the bacteria's response to phage infection. Cell lysis time is
generally taken from initial exposure to the first cell lysis and is generally measured in
minutes, however not all phages work this quickly and could be measure in hours. Burst size
is the number of infective virion forms of the phage ejected from a lysed cell, and is
measured in PFU/cell, or Plaque forming units (referring to phages) per cell lysed. I would
really like to see the interaction between PFU/cell and lysis time, as I would like to
understand if lysis time has to do with internal pressure from the contructed phages or if
it has to do with a function of the viral gene creating a protein to rip apart the cell
membrane. Another factor I am interested in is prior phage exposure. Bactera can evolve
resistance to antibiotics and I am curious to see how quickly they can adapt to phages, or
if they even need to be exposed to evolve resistance given HGT. Phage concentration is
another bit of data I could compare other categories to, to see how infection concentration
might affect other factors. One thing I would like to learn is how to plot multiple plots
over each other, or to compare them. Im sure you can see my graph, and I would really like to
learn how to plot multiple of the same/ similar graphs with the same x's and y's over each
other. For example, my limited fake data set is only for 1 isolated phage, and I'm curious
to see if it is possible to overlay the same graphs within R.
