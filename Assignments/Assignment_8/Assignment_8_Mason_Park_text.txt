1. Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain.
Yes, effect of nitrogen (both species) appeared to have no effect on the growth rate of the organism. For P.cornucopiae the intercept was
affected by only -0.3437, with P.ostreotus growth intercept being affected by 0.3716. Other factors affected our intercept by up to 526.86,
showing that relative to other factors, nitrogen seems to have little to no affect on the growth rate.
2. In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships? Do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with modeling non-linear relationships in R.
While looking into the effect light has on growth it was hard to not see an exponential growth pattern in P.cornucopiae. It also seemed
to scale with humiditiy, so I'm curious to see how to graph multiple relationships like this at the same time over model predictions.

3. Write the code you would use to model the data found in “/Data/non_linear_relationship.csv” with a linear model (there are a few ways of doing this)

# writing the code for /Data/non_linear_relationship.csv

df2 <- read.csv("../../Data/non_linear_relationship.csv")

mod5 <- glm(data = df2,
    formula = response ~ predictor,
    family = Gamma(link=log))

summary(mod5)
performance(mod5)    
# I have spent the last 3 hours trying to figure out how to graph this against the real data and I can't. The residuals look 
# really good and the R^2 looks good but when I plot it it does really weird garbage. I'm too tired for this I'll ask in class
